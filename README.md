## Cursor Agent Test

A tiny sandbox repository for experimenting with Cursor’s coding agents and
automations. Use it to verify how agents manipulate files, run commands, and
summarize their work.

### What You Can Try
- Edit files (like this README) and confirm agent diffs
- Practice running `git status`, `npm test`, or other workflows safely
- Rehearse explaining changes, writing summaries, or drafting PR notes

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <this-repo-url>`
2. Open it in Cursor (or your editor of choice)
3. Make edits and let the agent describe or review them

### Notes
- There is intentionally almost no code—add your own files as needed
- Resetting the repo is as easy as deleting and recloning it

### Contributing
Feel free to extend the playground with sample scripts, test data, or docs that
help you rehearse day-to-day tasks.
